O:
Today, we covered several key topics. We revisited the basics of React, focusing on components and state management. Additionally, we explored FlyWay, a tool used for database version control in SpringBoot applications. We also delved into Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), understanding their role and implementation in our projects. <br>

R:
I found it interesting to learn new concepts like DTOs and FlyWay. Drawing a concept map for SpringBoot was particularly useful as it helped me memorize and revise the related concepts effectively. It was also a great opportunity to refresh my knowledge about React basics, which I hadn't touched in a while. <br>

I:
Over the past few days, we have learned a lot about SpringBoot, but we didn't have much opportunity to organize the connections between different concepts. Drawing a concept map proved to be an excellent method for connecting our knowledge. Revisiting React fundamentals was beneficial as it allowed me to refresh my skills and knowledge. I was happy to see that I could still remember how to use React and help my groupmates, which boosted my confidence. <br>

D:
I plan to integrate the use of concept maps regularly to help organize and connect new information. This will aid in better retention and understanding of complex topics. I will also set aside time to periodically review and practice React to keep my skills sharp. Additionally, I aim to explore more tools like FlyWay that can enhance our development process and improve our project management capabilities. By doing so, I hope to continue building a strong foundation in both SpringBoot and React, ensuring that I can effectively contribute to the project in the last week. <br>
